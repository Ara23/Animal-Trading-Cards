			<p class="info">Peacock mantis shrimp are crustaceans, most closely resembling lobsters. They are very brightly colored, with a base body color of olive or green, brightly covered orange
				 antennae scales, red raptorial appendages (used to smash prey), red setae on their uropods, and leopard like spots covering the lateral sides of the lower carapace.
				 Their compound eyes are blue in color. Body coloration is sexually dimorphic, with males being being more brightly colored. The carapace is slightly raised,
				  covering only the lower half of the head, leaving the portion with the eyes exposed.</p>
